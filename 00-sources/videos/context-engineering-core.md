summary_long: >-
  The speaker introduces an advanced context engineering workflow for using AI coding agents effectively, especially in large, complex, and brownfield codebases. He argues that naive, conversational prompting leads to rework and is ineffective for complex tasks, comparing it to throwing away source code and only keeping the compiled asset. The proposed solution is a disciplined, spec-first development process divided into three phases: research, planning, and implementation. This method centers on frequent, intentional context compaction, aiming to keep context utilization under 40% by summarizing progress into structured markdown files. This ensures the agent always has a clean, correct, and complete understanding of its task. The workflow emphasizes human review of the research and planning stages, which is more efficient than reviewing thousands of lines of code and ensures team alignment on system changes.

  This talk presents a structured, spec-first workflow for AI-assisted coding that leverages advanced context engineering. By using a research-plan-implement cycle with frequent context compaction, developers can effectively guide AI agents to write production-ready code in large, complex systems.

# Advanced Context Engineering for Agents

## The Evolution of Context Engineering for AI Coding Agents

The term "context engineering" originated from the "12-Factor Agents" manifesto, which outlined principles for building reliable LLM applications. This approach focuses on optimizing the context provided to an AI model to achieve the best possible results.

## The Problem with Current AI Coding Agents

Despite advancements, using AI for software development faces significant challenges, particularly for complex tasks and existing codebases.

### Flawed Development Patterns

Sean Grove's talk, "The New Code," highlights a common anti-pattern in AI-assisted development, which he calls "vibe coding." This process involves:
1.  Interactively prompting an agent for hours to specify a desired outcome.
2.  Committing the final generated code.
3.  Discarding the entire prompt history.

This is analogous to a Java developer writing source code, compiling it into a JAR file, and then checking in the compiled JAR while deleting the original source code. The specification—the description of what the software should do—is the most valuable asset, yet it is often thrown away.

### The Challenge of Rework and Complexity

A Stanford study analyzing data from 100,000 developers revealed several key findings about AI in engineering:
*   **High Rework:** While AI can increase initial output, a significant portion of the generated code (often up to 50%) is later discarded due to sloppiness or incorrectness.
*   **Poor Performance on Complex Tasks:** AI agents struggle with complex, multi-step problems and "brownfield" projects (legacy codebases).
*   **Counter-Productivity:** For complex tasks in existing codebases, using AI can actually be counterproductive and slow developers down.

This aligns with the general consensus that current coding agents are effective for prototypes and greenfield projects but fail in large, complex systems. The prevailing belief is that we must wait for more advanced models, but context engineering argues we can get more from today's models by changing our approach.

## A Spec-First Development Workflow

To overcome these limitations, a "spec-first" development workflow was adopted out of necessity when dealing with massive, AI-generated pull requests (e.g., 20,000 lines of Go code). Reviewing such large changes is impractical, forcing a shift in focus from the code itself to the specification that generates it.

By trusting the specification and the tests, one can let go of reviewing every line of code, leading to a more efficient and scalable development process.

### Goals of This Workflow

This methodology is designed to achieve specific outcomes:
*   **Effectiveness in Large Codebases:** Works well in complex, existing systems.
*   **Solves Complex Problems:** Capable of handling significant engineering challenges.
*   **Production-Ready Code:** Generates high-quality, "no slop" code ready for shipping.
*   **Team Alignment:** Keeps everyone on the same page about what is being built and why.

## Strategies for Context Management

The core of advanced context engineering is managing the LLM's context window. LLMs are pure functions; the quality of the output is solely determined by the quality of the input. In a coding agent, every decision—which tool to call, what edit to make—is dictated by the content of its context window.

The worst things to have in a context window are:
1.  **Incorrect Information:** Leads the agent down the wrong path.
2.  **Missing Information:** Prevents the agent from making correct decisions.
3.  **Excessive Noise:** Dilutes the important signals, making it harder for the agent to focus.

The goal is to optimize the context for correctness, completeness, and size.

### Naive Interaction Patterns
*   **Shouting Match:** The most basic method is to argue back and forth with the agent, correcting it until you run out of context or patience.
*   **Restarting:** A slightly better approach is to recognize when an agent is off track, stop the session, and start a new one with a fresh context and a corrected prompt (e.g., "Try again, but do not do X because it doesn't work.").

### Intentional Compaction
A more advanced technique is **intentional compaction**. Instead of just restarting, you deliberately summarize the progress and key learnings into a concise format.
*   Even when on the right track, if the context window is filling up, you should be intentional about what is committed to the agent's memory.
*   A common practice is to have the agent write out a structured progress file (e.g., in Markdown). This file can then be used to "onboard" a new agent instance, giving it all the necessary context without the noise of the previous conversation.
*   This is superior to generic `slash-compact` commands, as it provides fine-grained control over what information is preserved.

### Using Sub-Agents for Context Control
Sub-agents are a powerful tool for context management. Instead of role-playing (e.g., a "product manager" agent), they should be used for specific, context-heavy tasks.
*   **Example:** A parent agent needs to find where a specific function is called in the codebase.
*   Instead of performing the search itself and cluttering its context window with file contents and search results, it can delegate this task to a sub-agent.
*   The sub-agent performs the search and returns a compact, structured response, such as a list of file paths and line numbers.
*   The parent agent receives only the final, clean result, preserving its context for the primary implementation task.

## The Three-Phase Workflow: Research, Plan, Implement

The most effective workflow builds the entire development process around frequent, intentional compaction. The goal is to keep context utilization under 40% at all times. This is achieved through a three-phase process.

### 1. Research Phase
*   **Goal:** Understand how the system works and identify all relevant files and code sections related to the task.
*   **Process:** An agent is given a prompt to explore the codebase and produce a research document.
*   **Output:** A detailed summary that includes file names and specific line numbers, allowing the next agent to know exactly where to look without performing its own search.

### 2. Planning Phase
*   **Goal:** Create a detailed, step-by-step plan for the required code changes.
*   **Process:** Using the research document as input, an agent generates an implementation plan.
*   **Output:** A document that specifies every change to be made, including file paths, code snippets for modification, and a clear strategy for testing and verification at each step.

### 3. Implementation Phase
*   **Goal:** Execute the plan and write the code.
*   **Process:** An agent takes the detailed plan and implements the changes. If the plan is high-quality, this phase requires minimal back-and-forth. If you find yourself "shouting" at the agent, it's a sign that the plan was insufficient.
*   **Context Management:** Throughout this phase, the plan is continuously updated to mark completed steps. When context utilization approaches the 40% threshold, a new agent instance is started with the updated plan, ensuring a fresh and focused context.

## Human Review and the Hierarchy of Leverage

This workflow is not fully automated; it is built around **intentional human review steps**. A human must review the outputs of the research and planning phases.

This is critical because there is a hierarchy of leverage in fixing errors:
*   A **bad line of code** is one incorrect line.
*   A **bad part of a plan** can result in hundreds of incorrect lines of code.
*   A **bad line of research** (a misunderstanding of the system) can result in thousands of incorrect lines of code.

By focusing review efforts on the research and planning stages, you can catch fundamental errors early, preventing massive amounts of rework. This is far more efficient than reviewing a 2,000-line pull request.

This process also reclaims the primary purpose of code review: **mental alignment**. Reviewing concise plans ensures the entire team maintains a shared understanding of how and why the system is evolving.

## Real-World Results

This workflow has been validated in real-world scenarios:

*   **Brownfield Codebase (BAML):** A bug fix was implemented in a 300,000-line Rust codebase. The process was so effective that the generated pull request was of such high quality that the project's CTO merged it without realizing it was part of an experiment.
*   **Complex Problem (Boundary):** In a 7-hour session, this process was used to add WASM support to a programming language, a task estimated to take 1-2 weeks. The session produced 35,000 lines of code.

An intern using this workflow shipped two pull requests on their first day and ten in a single day by their eighth day.

## What's Next: The Importance of Workflow Transformation

Coding agents themselves will likely become commoditized. The key differentiator for engineering teams will not be the specific AI tool they use, but their ability to transform their workflows and communication structures. Adopting new, structured methods of working with AI will be a difficult but necessary evolution for teams to remain effective.
