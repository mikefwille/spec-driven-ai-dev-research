# Advanced Context Engineering and Spec-Driven AI Development: Complete Workflow Example

## Scenario: Building a New AI-Powered Customer Support System

This document shows the complete workflow for implementing advanced context engineering on a brand new project from initial requirements through production deployment.

**Project Goal**: Build an AI customer support system that integrates with existing CRM, handles multiple communication channels (email, chat, phone), and escalates complex issues to humans.

---

## Phase 1: Project Initiation & Research

### Input: Initial Requirements
```
User Request: "We need an AI customer support system that can handle basic inquiries,
access customer data from our CRM, and escalate complex issues to human agents."

Business Context:
- Current team: 5 support agents handling 200 tickets/day
- Existing systems: Salesforce CRM, Zendesk, Slack
- Goal: Handle 70% of inquiries automatically
- Budget: 3 months development time
```

### Step 1.1: Create Research Command
**Command Used**: `/research_codebase`
**Input**: Project requirements document
**Human Action**: Review and clarify requirements

```markdown
Research Question: "What would be required to build an AI customer support system
that integrates with Salesforce CRM and Zendesk, handles multiple communication channels,
and includes human escalation workflows?"
```

### Step 1.2: Parallel Sub-Agent Research
**Agents Spawned**:

1. **web-search-researcher**: External API research
   - Salesforce API capabilities and authentication
   - Zendesk integration options
   - AI customer support best practices
   - Human-in-the-loop patterns for support

2. **codebase-pattern-finder**: Similar implementations
   - Look for existing customer support integrations in codebase
   - Find authentication patterns for third-party APIs
   - Identify communication channel handling patterns

3. **thoughts-locator**: Historical context
   - Previous customer support projects

# Research: AI Customer Support System Architecture

## Research Question
What would be required to build an AI customer support system that integrates with
Salesforce CRM and Zendesk, handles multiple communication channels, and includes
human escalation workflows?

## Summary
AI customer support system requires: (1) Multi-channel input processing, (2) CRM integration
for customer context, (3) LLM-powered response generation, (4) Human escalation triggers,
(5) Audit trail and quality monitoring.

## Detailed Findings

### Integration Requirements
- **Salesforce API**: REST API with OAuth 2.0, rate limits of 100k calls/24hrs
- **Zendesk API**: Tickets API for case management, Webhooks for real-time updates
- **Communication Channels**: Email (SMTP/IMAP), Chat (WebSocket), Phone (Twilio integration)

### Architecture Components
- **Input Router**: Channel-agnostic message processing
- **Context Engine**: Customer data aggregation from multiple sources
- **AI Response Generator**: LLM integration with guardrails and templates
- **Escalation Engine**: Rule-based and ML-based escalation decisions
- **Audit System**: Full conversation logging and quality scoring

### Technical Stack Recommendations
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI for API flexibility and AI library support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data + Redis for session management
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 with custom fine-tuning for domain knowledge
- **Queue System**: Celery for background processing and escalation workflows
- **Monitoring**: Datadog for system metrics + custom quality dashboards

### Human-in-the-Loop Integration Points
1. **Confidence Threshold Escalation**: <70% confidence auto-escalates
2. **Complex Issue Detection**: Multi-turn conversations beyond 5 exchanges
3. **Sensitive Topic Handling**: Financial, legal, or complaint keywords
4. **Quality Review**: Random sampling of AI responses for training feedback

## Code References
- Similar CRM integration: `integrations/salesforce_client.py:45-120`
- Existing escalation patterns: `workflows/support_routing.py:78-145`
- Authentication handling: `auth/oauth_manager.py:23-67`

## Architecture Insights
- Use event-driven architecture for real-time response requirements
- Implement circuit breakers for third-party API reliability
- Design for horizontal scaling with stateless request processing
- Build comprehensive audit trails for compliance and quality improvement

## Open Questions
- Customer data privacy requirements and data retention policies
- Integration testing strategy for multiple third-party systems
- Fallback procedures when AI or integrations are unavailable
- Metrics and SLA definitions for response quality and speed
```

**Human Review**: âœ… Approved - Architecture approach confirmed, privacy requirements clarified

---

## Phase 2: Implementation Planning

### Step 2.1: Create Implementation Plan
**Command Used**: `/create_plan`
**Input**: Research document + clarified requirements
**Human Action**: Review plan structure and approve phases

### Step 2.2: Sub-Agent Planning Research
**Agents Spawned**:

1. **codebase-analyzer**: Deep dive into existing patterns
   - Analyze current authentication implementation
   - Review existing API integration patterns
   - Study current error handling and monitoring setup

2. **thoughts-analyzer**: Historical decision analysis
   - Extract lessons learned from similar projects
   - Identify architectural decisions to maintain consistency
   - Review past integration challenges and solutions

### Step 2.3: Plan Creation & Human Review
**Output**: `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-09-18-ENG-2401-ai-customer-support-implementation.md`

# AI Customer Support System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Build production-ready AI customer support system with CRM integration, multi-channel
support, and human escalation workflows in 3 phases over 8 weeks.

## Current State Analysis
- No existing customer support automation
- Salesforce CRM with custom fields for customer context
- Zendesk for ticket management with custom workflows
- Team experienced with Python/FastAPI and PostgreSQL

## Desired End State
- AI handles 70% of support inquiries automatically
- Sub-2-minute response time for all channels
- Seamless escalation to human agents with full context
- Comprehensive audit trail and quality monitoring

## What We're NOT Doing
- Custom LLM training (using OpenAI GPT-4 with prompt engineering)
- Real-time voice processing (phone transcription only)
- Advanced sentiment analysis (basic keyword detection only)

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

### Overview

    conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id),
    sender_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'customer', 'ai', 'agent'
    content TEXT,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. API Integration Layer
**File**: `integrations/salesforce_client.py`
**Changes**: Salesforce API client with customer data fetching
```python
class SalesforceClient:
    def __init__(self, client_id, client_secret, instance_url):
        self.auth_manager = OAuth2Manager(client_id, client_secret)
        self.instance_url = instance_url

    async def get_customer_context(self, customer_id):

```python
class ResponseGenerator:
    def __init__(self, llm_client, context_builder):
        self.llm = llm_client
        self.context_builder = context_builder
