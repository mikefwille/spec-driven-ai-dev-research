# Spec-Driven AI Development Guide

## Overview

This document outlines all the artifacts, practices, and tools needed to implement the advanced context engineering methodology for AI coding agents, as described in the "Advanced Context Engineering for Agents" workflow. This edition includes detailed examples from HumanLayer's production implementation.

## Core Principles

- Keep context utilization under 40% at all times
- Focus on specification as the most valuable asset
- Use intentional compaction instead of naive interaction
- Implement human review at research and planning phases
- Leverage hierarchy of error prevention (research > planning > implementation)

## Required Artifacts & Tools

### 1. Intentional Compaction System

**Structured Progress Files**
- Comprehensive assessments including:
  - Primary objectives and success criteria
  - Information categorization and key elements
  - File change tracking with specific paths and line numbers
  - Action logs of important operations
  - Technical details about relationships between components
- Clean context summaries for agent onboarding
- Progress state preservation between sessions
- Semantic structure preservation (keep user messages, compress assistant outputs)

**Context Management Tools**
- Logarithmic sampling for efficient token monitoring (avoids counting every token)
- Pattern-based sequence identification for compactible message sequences
- Context-aware summarization using specialized prompts
- Entropy analysis to ensure information density stays within acceptable parameters
- 40% context utilization threshold maintenance
- Session restart protocols with context preservation
- XML over JSON preference for token efficiency (more meaning-dense representations)

# Token Budget Allocation Example
class ContextBudgetManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_budget = 200_000  # tokens per session
        self.allocations = {
            'research_phase': 0.30,    # 60k tokens
            'planning_phase': 0.25,    # 50k tokens
            'implementation': 0.35,    # 70k tokens
            'buffer_reserve': 0.10     # 20k tokens
        }

    def get_phase_budget(self, phase):
        return int(self.total_budget * self.allocations[phase])

    def monitor_usage(self, current_tokens, phase):
        budget = self.get_phase_budget(phase)
        utilization = current_tokens / budget

        if utilization > 0.40:
            return 'trigger_compaction'
        elif utilization > 0.30:
            return 'monitor_closely'
        else:
            return 'continue'
```

**Cost Monitoring & Alerts**
- Real-time token utilization tracking
- Phase budget overrun alerts
- Subagent cost attribution
- ROI measurement per task complexity

## Production Implementation: HumanLayer Commands

HumanLayer has implemented a production-grade system that directly implements the Advanced Context Engineering methodology through structured Claude Code commands. This section details how each principle is implemented in practice.

### Three-Phase Command Structure

#### `/research_codebase` - Research Phase Implementation

**Purpose**: Conducts comprehensive research across codebases by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing findings into structured documentation.

**Key Features**:
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Spawning**: Uses specialized agents for different research types
- **Structured Documentation**: Creates timestamped research documents in `thoughts/shared/research/`
- **Context Preservation**: Full YAML frontmatter with git commit, researcher, and metadata
- **Cross-Component Analysis**: Identifies patterns and architectural connections

**Sub-Agent Strategy in Practice**:
- **codebase-locator**: Finds WHERE code lives without cluttering context
- **codebase-analyzer**: Analyzes HOW specific implementations work
- **thoughts-locator**: Discovers historical documentation and decisions
- **linear-ticket-reader**: Fetches specific ticket details for context

**Command Flow**:
```markdown
1. User provides research question
2. Read any directly mentioned files FULLY first
3. Spawn parallel sub-agents for comprehensive research:
   - codebase-locator for file discovery
   - codebase-analyzer for implementation details
   - thoughts-locator for historical context
4. Wait for ALL sub-agents to complete
5. Synthesize findings into structured document
6. Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to preserve knowledge
```

#### `/create_plan` - Planning Phase Implementation

**Purpose**: Creates detailed implementation plans through interactive, iterative process with skeptical, thorough review and collaboration.

**Context Engineering Features**:
- **Mandatory File Reading**: Reads all mentioned files FULLY before planning
- **Human Review Checkpoints**: Structure approval before detailed writing
- **Success Criteria Separation**: Automated vs manual verification clearly defined
- **No Open Questions Rule**: All decisions resolved before plan completion

**Intentional Compaction Example**:
```markdown
# Plan Structure Template
## Current State Analysis
[What exists now, with file:line references]

## Desired End State
[Specification with verification criteria]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]
### Success Criteria:
#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] Migration applies: `make migrate`
- [ ] Tests pass: `make test-component`
- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Feature works in UI
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load
```

**Planning Process**:
```markdown
1. Read ticket files and context documents completely
2. Spawn research sub-tasks to gather context in parallel
3. Read ALL files identified by research tasks into main context
4. Present informed understanding and focused questions
5. Create plan outline and get structure approval
6. Write detailed plan with specific file paths and changes
7. Sync with `humanlayer thoughts sync`
```

#### `/implement_plan` - Implementation Phase

**Purpose**: Executes approved plans with progress tracking and context management.

**Context Management Features**:
- **Plan Progress Tracking**: Updates checkboxes in real-time
- **Context Refresh Detection**: Monitors when to start fresh agent instances
- **Forward Momentum**: Focuses on solution implementation, not re-research

**Implementation Philosophy**:
```markdown
Plans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:
- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find
- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next
- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context
- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections
```

### Specialized Sub-Agents for Context Control

#### `codebase-locator.md`
```yaml
name: codebase-locator
description: Locates files, directories, and components relevant to a feature or task
tools: Grep, Glob, LS
```

**Purpose**: Pure file discovery without content analysis to prevent context pollution.

**Output Format**:
```markdown
## File Locations for [Feature]

### Implementation Files
- `src/services/feature.js` - Main service logic
- `src/handlers/feature-handler.js` - Request handling

### Test Files
- `src/services/__tests__/feature.test.js` - Service tests

### Entry Points
- `src/index.js` - Imports feature module at line 23
```

#### `codebase-analyzer.md`
```yaml
name: codebase-analyzer
description: Analyzes code structure and implementation patterns
```

**Purpose**: Deep analysis of specific code sections identified by locator agents.

#### `codebase-pattern-finder.md`
```yaml
name: codebase-pattern-finder
description: Finds similar implementations and patterns to model after
```

**Purpose**: Identifies existing patterns and conventions to follow.

#### `thoughts-locator.md` & `thoughts-analyzer.md`
```yaml
name: thoughts-locator
description: Discovers documentation and historical decisions
```

**Purpose**: Historical context research without cluttering main agent context.

**Key Insight**: These agents implement the core principle of using sub-agents for "specific, context-heavy tasks" rather than role-playing agents.

### Context Session Management

#### Structured Progress Tracking
```markdown
## Context Session History
- **Session #1** (2025-09-18 10:30): Initial research, completed foundation analysis
- **Session #2** (2025-09-18 14:15): Context refreshed at 38% utilization, starting implementation
- **Session #3** (2025-09-18 16:45): Context refreshed after backend completion
```

#### Metadata Generation
Uses `hack/spec_metadata.sh` to automatically capture:
- Current git commit hash
- Branch name and repository info
- Researcher identity and timestamp
- Context session boundaries

### Integration with External Systems

#### Linear Integration
```markdown
## Workflow States
- "research needed" → `/research_codebase`
- "ready for spec" → `/create_plan`
- "ready for dev" → `/implement_plan`
```

**Linear MCP Tools**:
- `mcp__linear__list_issues` - Query tickets by status
- `mcp__linear__create_issue` - Create new tickets
- `mcp__linear__update_issue` - Move tickets through workflow
- `mcp__linear__create_comment` - Add context and updates

#### GitHub Integration
- PR creation: `gh pr create --fill`
- Diff analysis: `gh pr diff {number}`
- Permalink generation for permanent references
- Repository management: `gh repo view --json owner,name`

#### Documentation Sync
- `humanlayer thoughts sync` - Maintains centralized knowledge base
- Structured frontmatter for searchability
- Cross-reference linking between documents

### Verification and Quality Control

#### Automated Verification Patterns
```bash
# Standard verification commands
make migrate          # Database changes
make test-component   # Unit tests
make lint            # Code quality
make check           # Full verification suite
```

#### Manual Verification Checklist
```markdown
- [ ] Feature appears correctly in UI
- [ ] Performance acceptable with 1000+ items
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Works correctly on mobile devices
```

- **Bad line of research:** Thousands of incorrect lines
- **Focus review effort early in the process for maximum leverage**

**The "Compaction Stack" Architecture**
1. **System Prompts:** Agent architecture and control flow definitions
2. **Tool Schemas:** Available tools and interface specifications
3. **Dynamic Inputs:** Real-time information triggering current tasks
4. **Retrieved Knowledge:** External knowledge base connections via RAG

**12-Factor Agents Principles (Referenced Framework)**
- Treat agents as engineered systems with explicit interfaces
- Implement comprehensive logging and observability
- Use structured testing and validation approaches
- Design for reliability, not just capability
- Maintain separation between configuration and code
- Handle failures gracefully with recovery protocols

## Implementation Checklist for Other Teams

### Core Requirements (Platform Agnostic)
- [ ] **Three-phase workflow**: Research → Plan → Implement commands
- [ ] **Sub-agent architecture**: Specialized agents for context-heavy tasks
- [ ] **Structured documentation**: Timestamped files with metadata
- [ ] **Human review checkpoints**: Approval gates between phases
- [ ] **Context utilization tracking**: Monitor and refresh at 40% threshold

### Integration Requirements (Adaptable)
- [ ] **Project management integration**: Link workflow to ticket states
- [ ] **Version control integration**: Automatic metadata capture
- [ ] **Verification automation**: Standardized success criteria commands
- [ ] **Documentation system**: Centralized knowledge preservation

### Advanced Features (Optional)
- [ ] **Parallel research spawning**: Multiple sub-agents for efficiency
- [ ] **Context session logging**: Track refresh points and decisions
- [ ] **Automated permalink generation**: Permanent reference links
- [ ] **Cross-project knowledge sharing**: Searchable decision history

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Common Anti-Patterns & Solutions**

| Anti-Pattern | Symptoms | Solution |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| Vibe Coding | Iterative prompting for hours, discarded context | Implement spec-first workflow |
| Context Overflow | Agent confusion, repetitive questions | Trigger intentional compaction at 40% |
| Shouting Match | Circular corrections, same mistakes | Stop session, reset with improved context |
| Specification Drift | Code-spec misalignment over time | Regular validation, automated cross-checking |
| Review Bottleneck | All reviews focus on final code | Shift review focus to research and planning phases |

**Recovery Protocols**
```markdown
# When Things Go Wrong

## Context Overflow Emergency
1. Immediately pause current session
2. Create structured progress summary
3. Extract key decisions and learnings
4. Start fresh session with compressed context
5. Update methodology to prevent recurrence

## Agent Stuck/Confused
1. Identify specific confusion point
2. Check for "bad line of research" - fundamental misunderstanding
3. If research issue: restart research phase with corrected prompt
4. If planning issue: revise plan with human input
5. If implementation issue: check if plan was insufficient

## Quality Degradation
1. Audit recent context compressions for information loss
2. Verify specification-code alignment
3. Run quality metrics on recent outputs
4. Implement additional validation checkpoints
5. Consider human review frequency adjustment

## Implementation Notes

- **Methodology Origin:** Developed by Dexter Horthy (Human Layer founder) out of necessity when dealing with massive AI-generated pull requests (20,000+ lines)
- **Production Implementation:** HumanLayer's .claude configuration demonstrates full methodology implementation
- **Validation:** Tested on 300,000-line Rust codebases, complex WASM implementations, enterprise customer service systems
- **Core Philosophy:** Treat AI agents as engineered systems requiring explicit control, not magic black boxes
- **Team Impact:** Coding agents will become commoditized; differentiation comes from workflow transformation capabilities
- **Human Review Strategy:** Intentional and strategic, focused on high-leverage points (research/planning) rather than comprehensive code review
- **Context Engineering:** Represents evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated information environment orchestration
- **Future Direction:** Emphasis on engineering discipline, reliability, observability, and production-grade AI system development
