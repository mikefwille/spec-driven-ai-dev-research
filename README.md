### About This Structure

- Files organize by content type and purpose
- Sources provide input, methodologies are the core frameworks, examples demonstrate application
- Easy to identify what's "ready to use" vs "still processing"
- Production tools separate from research materials

## Core Methodology: Advanced Context Engineering and Spec-Driven Development

**The primary methodology documented in this repository**: A three-phase workflow (Research â†’ Plan â†’ Implement) for production-ready AI-assisted development in large codebases.

### ðŸš€ New to This Methodology?

**Start here:** [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) - One-page cheat sheet with visual flow diagram, commands, and checkpoints. Perfect for developers who want to get started immediately.

### Key Documents

- ðŸŽ¯ **[PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md)** - Why this matters: the case for advanced context engineering and spec-driven development
- ðŸ“˜ **[advanced-context-engineering-guide](01-methodologies/advanced-context-engineering-guide.md)** - Complete implementation guide with production examples
- ðŸ’¡ **[example-workflow](02-examples/example-workflow.md)** - Practical walkthrough of the methodology in action

### Key Concepts

- **40% context utilization threshold** - Keep agent context lean and focused
- **Three-phase workflow** - Research â†’ Plan â†’ Implement with human checkpoints
- **Sub-agent patterns** - Delegate context-heavy tasks to specialized agents
- **Specification-first** - The spec is the primary asset, not the code
- **Hierarchy of leverage** - Review research/plans, test code

### Production Tools

The `tools/` directory contains production-oriented Claude Code extensions:

**Agents** (`tools/agents/`):
- `codebase-locator.md` - Finds WHERE code lives (no analysis, pure search)
- `codebase-analyzer.md` - Analyzes HOW specific code works
- `codebase-pattern-finder.md` - Finds similar implementations to model after
- `thoughts-locator.md` - Discovers historical documentation
- `thoughts-analyzer.md` - Extracts insights from specific documents
- `web-search-researcher.md` - Conducts focused web research

**Commands** (`tools/commands/`):

*Core Three-Phase Workflow:*
- `/research_codebase` - Phase 1: Spawns parallel sub-agents for comprehensive research
- `/research_codebase_generic` - Generic version without HumanLayer-specific patterns
- `/create_plan` - Phase 2: Creates detailed, phased implementation plans
- `/create_plan_generic` - Generic version without HumanLayer-specific patterns
- `/implement_plan` - Phase 3: Executes plans with progress tracking
- `/validate_plan` - Reviews implementation plans for completeness

*Automated Workflow (Ralph):*
- `/ralph_research` - Fetches "research needed" tickets and spawns research
- `/ralph_plan` - Fetches "ready for spec" tickets and creates plans
- `/ralph_impl` - Fetches "ready for dev" tickets and implements

*Git & PR Management:*
- `/commit` - Creates well-formatted git commits with proper messages
- `/describe_pr` - Generates comprehensive PR descriptions from diffs
- `/create_worktree` - Manages git worktrees for parallel work

*Integration & Utilities:*
- `/linear` - Linear ticket management and workflow automation
- `/local_review` - Reviews code changes before committing
- `/debug` - Debugging assistance and troubleshooting
- `/founder_mode` - High-level strategic decision making

**Note**: Claude Code automatically discovers these tools when added to the .claude directory.

## Quick Start

### Using the Methodology

**For Developers (Quick Reference):**
1. **Read [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - Get started in 5 minutes with the visual workflow guide
2. **Copy tools to your project**: `tools/agents/` and `tools/commands/` â†’ `.claude/` in your project
3. **Run your first workflow**: `/research_codebase` â†’ review â†’ `/create_plan` â†’ review â†’ `/implement_plan`

**For Deep Understanding:**
1. **Start with the philosophy**: Read `PHILOSOPHY.md` to understand why this matters
2. **Read the full guide**: `01-methodologies/advanced-context-engineering-guide.md`
3. **See examples**: Review documents in `02-examples/`

### Processing New Research

1. **Identify source type** (video, article, repo)
3. **Save to correct folder** based on content type
4. **Link relationships** in YAML frontmatter

### Finding Content

- **By content type**: Browse folder structure (`00-sources/` â†’ `01-methodologies/` â†’ `02-examples/`)
- **By topic**: Use Obsidian search with metadata tags
- **By relationship**: Follow wiki-links in document frontmatter

## Implementation Status
