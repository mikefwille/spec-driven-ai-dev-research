# AI Development Research

A curated collection of AI development methodologies, production implementations, and research materials focused on effective AI-assisted software development.

## Repository Structure

Research is organized by **maturity level** with supporting production tooling:

```
ai-dev/
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/               # ðŸ”§ Production implementation tools
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agents/          # Custom Claude Code agents
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ commands/        # Custom Claude Code commands
â”œâ”€â”€ 00-sources/          # ðŸ“š Raw, unprocessed material
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ videos/          # YouTube transcripts and analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ articles/        # Saved articles and papers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repos/           # Code examples and implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-methodologies/    # ðŸ“˜ Processed, actionable frameworks
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-examples/         # ðŸ’¡ Practical applications and workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-experiments/      # ðŸ§ª Work-in-progress, testing ideas
â””â”€â”€ templates/           # ðŸ“‹ Reusable document templates
```

### Benefits of This Structure

- Files sort naturally by maturity stage
- Clear progression: source â†’ methodology â†’ example â†’ experiment
- Easy to identify what's "ready to use" vs "still processing"
- Production tools separate from research materials

## Core Methodology: Spec-Driven AI Development

**The primary methodology documented in this repository**: A three-phase workflow (Research â†’ Plan â†’ Implement) for production-ready AI-assisted development in large codebases.

### Key Documents

- ðŸ“˜ **[[spec-driven-ai-guide]]** - Complete implementation guide with production examples
- ðŸ“¹ **[[context-engineering-boundary]]** - Source video analysis (Boundary)
- ðŸ“¹ **[[context-engineering-core]]** - Core principles (YC Root Access)

### Key Concepts

- **40% context utilization threshold** - Keep agent context lean and focused
- **Three-phase workflow** - Research â†’ Plan â†’ Implement with human checkpoints
- **Sub-agent patterns** - Delegate context-heavy tasks to specialized agents
- **Specification-first** - The spec is the primary asset, not the code
- **Hierarchy of leverage** - Review research/plans, not just code

### Production Tools

The `tools/` directory contains production-ready Claude Code extensions:

**Agents** (`tools/agents/`):
- `codebase-locator.md` - Finds WHERE code lives (no analysis, pure search)
- `codebase-analyzer.md` - Analyzes HOW specific code works
- `codebase-pattern-finder.md` - Finds similar implementations to model after
- `thoughts-locator.md` - Discovers historical documentation
- `thoughts-analyzer.md` - Extracts insights from specific documents
- `web-search-researcher.md` - Conducts focused web research

**Commands** (`tools/commands/`):

*Core Three-Phase Workflow:*
- `/research_codebase` - Phase 1: Spawns parallel sub-agents for comprehensive research
- `/research_codebase_generic` - Generic version without HumanLayer-specific patterns
- `/create_plan` - Phase 2: Creates detailed, phased implementation plans
- `/create_plan_generic` - Generic version without HumanLayer-specific patterns
- `/implement_plan` - Phase 3: Executes plans with progress tracking
- `/validate_plan` - Reviews implementation plans for completeness

*Automated Workflow (Ralph):*
- `/ralph_research` - Fetches "research needed" tickets and spawns research
- `/ralph_plan` - Fetches "ready for spec" tickets and creates plans
- `/ralph_impl` - Fetches "ready for dev" tickets and implements

*Git & PR Management:*
- `/commit` - Creates well-formatted git commits with proper messages
- `/describe_pr` - Generates comprehensive PR descriptions from diffs
- `/create_worktree` - Manages git worktrees for parallel work

*Integration & Utilities:*
- `/linear` - Linear ticket management and workflow automation
- `/local_review` - Reviews code changes before committing
- `/debug` - Debugging assistance and troubleshooting
- `/founder_mode` - High-level strategic decision making

**Note**: Claude Code automatically discovers these tools when working in this directory.

## Quick Start

### Using the Methodology

1. **Start with the guide**: Read `01-methodologies/spec-driven-ai-guide.md`
2. **Explore the tools**: Check `tools/agents/` and `tools/commands/`
3. **See examples**: Review documents in `02-examples/`

### Processing New Research

1. **Identify source type** (video, article, repo)
2. **Use appropriate template** from `templates/`
3. **Save to correct folder** based on maturity
4. **Link relationships** in YAML frontmatter

### Finding Content

- **By maturity**: Browse folder structure (`00-sources/` â†’ `01-methodologies/` â†’ `02-examples/`)
- **By topic**: Use Obsidian search with metadata tags
- **By relationship**: Follow wiki-links in document frontmatter
